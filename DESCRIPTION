Description: A suite of tools to build attractive command line interfaces
    ('CLIs'), from semantic elements: headings, lists, alerts, paragraphs,
    etc. Supports custom themes via a 'CSS'-like language. It also
    contains a number of lower level 'CLI' elements: rules, boxes, trees,
    and 'Unicode' symbols with 'ASCII' alternatives. It support ANSI
    colors and text styles as well.
