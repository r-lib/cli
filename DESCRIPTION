Description: A suite of tools to build attractive command line interfaces
    ('CLIs'), from semantic elements: headings, lists, alerts, paragraphs,
    etc. Supports theming via a 'CSS'-like language. It also contains a
    number of lower level 'CLI' elements: rules, boxes, trees, and
    'Unicode' symbols with 'ASCII' alternatives. It integrates with the
    'crayon' package to support 'ANSI' terminal colors.
